                    <div class="content1">My name is Sibo Hu and I am studying for the Master of Computing degree. This is my second year at ANU.
                    Learning this major at the beginning is for the convenience of employment. 
                    But in the learning process, I found myself more interested in the design direction, that is, product, user research, UI/UX design. 
                    Therefore, I hope to systematically studying some front-end knowledge and I took COMP6780 in this semester.

                    Since I'm not at home right now, and I only have this selfie in my phone, so I put it up. Of course, I love the background.

                    <div class="content1">In daily life, my hobbies involve a lot of aspects, and I prefer some quiet indoor and outdoor activities. 
                        Indoor activities such as going to various exhibitions, visiting museums and so on.

                    <div class="content1">One of the interesting outdoor activities I did was to participate in an underwater historical site exploration in when I was 9 years old. 
                        A related regret is that I missed the excavation and restoration project of a tomb of vassal king led by my professor in college. 
                        This professor is engaged in bronze ware restoration, and the other professor is engaged in painting restoration. Both of them are my interests.

                        Before 2020, I mainly shot natural scenery, but after the COVID 19, I rarely traveled and my shooting content gradually changed to life records and people.
